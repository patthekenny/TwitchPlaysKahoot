IDEAS:
 - 25% vote skip current kahoot?
 - add queue of kahoots(verify before adding to queue)
 - sub priority if I ever get sub button
 - don't let person put one in queue more than once per x min?
NOTES:

https://play.kahoot.it/#/intro?quizId=

^^ THIS URL WILL AUTOSTART QUIZ, ADD QUIZ ID AFTER!

MALFORMED URL GIVES "Hmm... we can't seem to find this kahoot." in page.

GOING FROM https://play.kahoot.it/#/lobby?quizId=2c249143-1e1e-4be7-a91b-1dbd1b68d614 
AND CHANGING "lobby" to "play" WORKS,
AND TAKES ALL PEOPLE IN LOBBY TO GAME! DO THIS AFTER 30s!(maybe time depends on amount of people watching)

<strong ng-bind-html="gamePin" data-functional-selector="game-pin" class="ng-binding">6969696</strong>

need to make webview in beginning, not use inherrent one
